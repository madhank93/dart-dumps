```
Dart doesn't support access modifier like (private, protected, public).
Instead, you can use _(underscore) at the beginning of a variable name of function.
In Dart, the privacy is at library level rather than class level. It means other classes and functions in the same library still have the access.
It is either public (if it is not preceded by _) or private (if it is preceded by _)
